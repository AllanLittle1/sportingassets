## Example Interactions

Q: What are the main components of our club's social value according to Value FC?
A: Value FC breaks down your club's social value into four main components:
1. Wellbeing impact on players aged over 16
2. Wellbeing impact on children and young people aged under 16
3. Wellbeing boost for volunteers
4. Value of time contributed by volunteers

The app calculates percentages for each of these components, allowing you to see which areas contribute most to your overall social value. This breakdown can help you highlight your club's strengths when communicating with stakeholders or applying for funding.

Q: How does Value FC account for the possibility that some of our players or volunteers might engage in other activities if our club didn't exist?
A: Value FC acknowledges this important consideration:
1. The app provides a total benefits calculation for all involved, without directly accounting for alternative activities.
2. It recognises that some players and volunteers might engage with other clubs, sports, or social activities if your club didn't exist.
3. To address this, Value FC calculates a "breakeven additionality percentage". This shows what percentage of your estimated return needs to be genuinely 'additional' to cover your investment costs.
4. This approach provides a starting point for discussions with partners about your club's unique value, while being transparent about the limitations of the estimation.

Q: Can you explain what a WELLBY is and how it's used in Value FC?
A: Certainly! WELLBY is a key concept in Value FC:
1. WELLBY stands for Wellbeing Year. It's based on the question: "Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?"
2. This question uses a scale from 0 (not at all satisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied).
3. One WELLBY represents improving someone's life satisfaction by one point over a year.
4. The UK Treasury values one WELLBY at £15,258 (in 2023 prices).
5. Value FC uses WELLBYs to quantify how your club improves wellbeing through football participation and volunteering.
6. This method is endorsed by the UK Government and is becoming the gold standard for social value measurement in sport.

Q: How does Value FC estimate the wellbeing impact for different groups in our club?
A: Value FC estimates wellbeing impacts differently for various groups:
1. Players over 16: Gain 0.093 WELLBYs, valued at £1,419 per year
2. Players under 16: Gain 0.371 WELLBYs, worth £5,661 per year
3. Volunteers: Benefit by 0.066 WELLBYs, worth £1,007 per year

These estimates come from State of Life's analysis of Sport England's Active Lives Survey, focusing on regular participants (at least twice monthly for 10+ minutes per session). The analysis uses regression techniques to isolate football's specific impact while controlling for various factors affecting life satisfaction.

Q: How does Value FC handle volunteer contributions in its calculations?
A: Value FC treats volunteer contributions in a nuanced way:
1. Time as investment: It values volunteer time as a social investment, recognizing the opportunity cost of volunteering.
2. Time as benefit: It also considers volunteer time as a benefit to the club, representing the 'replacement value' of services provided.
3. Wellbeing impact: Additionally, it calculates the wellbeing boost volunteers receive from their involvement.
4. Calculation method: It estimates each volunteer contributes £1,125.36 worth of time per season (12 hours x 9 months x £10.42 National Living Wage).
5. Balanced approach: While the time value cancels out in net calculations, including it is crucial for accurately representing the Social Return on Investment ratio.

This method ensures a comprehensive valuation of volunteering, capturing both its economic and wellbeing impacts.

Q: What are some limitations of the Value FC model that we should be aware of?
A: While Value FC provides valuable insights, it's important to be aware of its limitations:
1. National averages: The estimates are based on national surveys, not data specific to your club members.
2. Variations not captured: Wellbeing impacts can vary based on factors like gender and game type, which aren't individually accounted for in the model.
3. Alternative activities: The model doesn't directly account for what participants might do if your club didn't exist.
4. First approximation: It's designed as a starting point for understanding and communicating social value, not a comprehensive scientific evaluation.
5. Local nuances: It may not capture all the specific nuances of your local area and community.

Despite these limitations, Value FC offers a credible, cost-effective way to demonstrate your club's value, especially when more expensive, bespoke research isn't feasible for grassroots clubs.

Q: How can we use the Value FC report to make a case for our club's importance?
A: The Value FC report provides several powerful tools for making your case:
1. Quantified impact: Use the Social Return on Investment (SROI) ratio to show how efficiently you generate social value from investments.
2. Net social value: Highlight the annual net social value to demonstrate your overall community impact.
3. Wellbeing focus: Emphasize how you're improving lives through the WELLBY concept, which is becoming a gold standard in social value measurement.
4. Volunteer value: Showcase both the economic and wellbeing value of your volunteers.
5. Credible methodology: Mention that the approach is backed by HM Treasury guidance and developed by experts in the field.
6. Transparency: Acknowledge the limitations of the model, which adds credibility to your claims.
7. Local relevance: While based on national data, argue that your club is best placed to deliver these benefits in your specific community.
