To make the content more efficient for an LLM to access, read, and use for training and user responses, we should structure the information in a clear, concise, and indexed format. This involves organizing the sections by topic, using bullet points for clarity, and providing explicit headings for easy navigation. Here’s a restructured version:

### Adjustments for Inflation

#### Overview
- Costs and benefits should be estimated in ‘real’ base year prices.
- General inflation effects should be removed using the GDP deflator.

#### Methods for Adjusting Prices
- **Short Time Horizons**: Use whole economy inflation (GDP deflator) from the most recent OBR forecasts.
- **Long Time Horizons**: Use GDP deflator forecasts from the OBR Fiscal Sustainability Report (FSR).
- **Beyond FSR**: Extrapolate GDP deflator using the growth rate in the final year of the OBR’s projection.

#### Table: Adjusting for the Effects of Inflation (2% GDP Deflator)
| Year   | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    |
|--------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Nominal terms (£) | 1,000 | 1,000 | 1,000 | 1,000 | 1,000 | 1,000 |
| Real terms (£)    | 1,000 | 980  | 961  | 942  | 924  | 906  |

#### Relative Price Effect
- **Concept**: Specific price index movements may differ from general inflation.
- **Application**: Use historical evidence and future expectations to apply different inflation rates. 
  - Example: Information Technology prices decrease over time, land prices increase.
- **Requirements**: Assumptions must be based on objective evidence and clearly stated in the business case.

### Discounting and Social Time Preference

#### Overview
- **Purpose**: Compare costs and benefits over different time periods consistently.
- **Basis**: Time preference; people prefer goods/services sooner rather than later.

#### Components of STPR
- **Time Preference**: Rate at which consumption and public spending are discounted, assuming no per capita consumption change.
- **Wealth Effect**: Reflects expected growth in per capita consumption over time.

#### Standard Discount Rates
- **General**: 3.5% in real terms.
- **Risk to Life Values**: 1.5%.
- **Declining Rates for Long-Term**: Steps down over 30+ years due to future uncertainty.

#### Table: Present Values and Discount Rate (3.5% Rate)
| Year   | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   |
|--------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Value (£) | 1,000 | 966  | 934  | 902  | 871  | 842  | 814  | 786  | 759  | 734  | 709  |

#### Practical Application
- **Inflation and Discounting**: Separate adjustments; first convert to real prices, then apply discounting.
- **Never Retrospective**: Do not apply discounting to past costs/benefits.
- **Government Funds**: STPR is not linked to costs of raising funds.

### Box 15: NPSV and Discounting Example
- **Option A**: Initial cost £10m, annual benefit £2.5m for 4 years.
  - NPSV: -£0.82m
- **Option B**: Initial cost £5m, annual benefit £1.5m for 4 years.
  - NPSV: £0.51m

#### Discount Factors Example
| Year   | 0      | 1      | 2      | 3      | 4      |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Factor | 1      | 0.9662 | 0.9335 | 0.9019 | 0.8714 |

### Wellbeing Guidance for Appraisal

#### WELLBY value

The value of a WELLBY is £13,000 in 2019 prices

#### Calculating Willingness to Pay (WTP) for Life Satisfaction Changes
- **Method**: Analysis of ln(income) and life satisfaction.
  - Coefficient on ln(income): 1.25 (life satisfaction on 1-7 scale).
  - WELLBY: Aggregation of WTP for gains in life satisfaction.
- **Formula**: \( WTP_{\text{WELLBY}} = \left[ f'(\ln(M)) \cdot M \right]^{-1} = M^{\beta_Y} \)
  - \( \beta_Y \): Coefficient on ln(income) on 0-10 scale.
  - For ln(income) coefficient of 1.25 on 1-7 scale, \( \beta_Y = \frac{11}{7} \cdot 1.25 = 1.96 \).
- **Calculation**: WTP per WELLBY with average earnings (£30,673 in 2019):
  - \( WTP_{\text{WELLBY}} = \frac{£30,673}{1.96} = £15,649 \)
  - Rounded to £16,000.
- **Central Recommended WELLBY Value**: Mid-point of £10,023 and £15,649.
  - \( WTP_{\text{WELLBY}} = \frac{10,000 + 16,000}{2} = £13,000 \)

#### Adjusting for Price Year and Discounting
- **Formula**: 
  - \( WTP_{\text{WELLBY}_t} = WTP_{\text{WELLBY}_{\text{base}}} \cdot \frac{GDP_{\text{deflator}_t}}{GDP_{\text{deflator}_{\text{base}}}} \cdot \left( \frac{GDP_{\text{per capita}_t}}{GDP_{\text{per capita}_{\text{base}}}} \right)^{1.3} \)
  - 1.3: Negative of marginal utility of income elasticity.
- **Discount Rate for Wellbeing**: Green Book ‘health’ discount rate (1.5% for years 0-30, declining thereafter).
